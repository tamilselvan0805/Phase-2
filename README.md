# üè° House Price Prediction using Smart Regression Techniques

This project uses data science and machine learning to accurately forecast house prices based on various property features. It applies advanced regression models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, and includes a web application for real-time price predictions.

## üìÅ Dataset
A sample dataset is included in the repository as `sample_house_prices.csv`, which contains the following features:
- LotArea
- YearBuilt
- OverallQual
- OverallCond
- GrLivArea
- FullBath
- GarageCars
- GarageArea
- SalePrice

## üîß Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, Random Forest
- Flask (for web deployment)
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## üìä Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, RF, XGBoost)
5. Model Evaluation (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE)
6. Web App Deployment using Flask
7. Future Scope and Continuous Improvement

## üöÄ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```
4. Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## üìå Future Enhancements
- Integration with live property listing APIs
- Geospatial visualization using Folium
- Deep learning model for image-based prediction
- Mobile app and dashboard deployment
